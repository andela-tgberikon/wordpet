WORDPET
============

Have you searched for so many words over time that you don't remember what they were again? would it not be nice to have all your dictionary search history so you can keep track of your vocabulary?

In comes wordpet.

its a basic consumption of a [WordsAPI](http://www.wordsapi.com/) API but added some advanced functions to it.

Enjoy!
